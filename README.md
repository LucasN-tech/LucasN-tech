## 💼 About Me

I’m a software developer with over 5 years of experience focused on enterprise automation, ERP integration, and scalable REST API development.

Proficient in .NET Framework, .NET 6/7, ASP.NET, SQL Server, and VB.NET. On the frontend, I build performant SPAs using React, Zustand, MUI, and Ant Design.

I work with **microservices architecture** and follow **Clean Architecture** principles with a layered approach (API → Application → Domain → Infrastructure), ensuring maintainability and scalability.

I have a strong analytical mindset, am self-taught, and fully committed to delivering efficient and robust software solutions.
